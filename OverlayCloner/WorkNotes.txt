// Relevant resources to overlays:
/*
 * BINX : need new groups. Don't seem to be referred to by anything, but have matching instances with some 3IDRs.
 * 
 * 3IDR : most need new groups, updated references.
 *        The one with group = 0x4F184AA9 should have its instance updated instead.
 *        Out of package references should not be changed.
 * 
 * GZPS & XTOL : need new groups, new families; referred to by some 3IDRs.
 * 
 * STR : should be one. Need new group, new/updated content. Referred to by some 3IDRs.
 * 
 * TXMT : need new groups, new names & descriptions, TGI fix. Referred to by some 3IDRs.
 * TXTR : need new groups, new names, TGI fix. Referred to by TXMTs.
 *        How to handle references to exterior textures?
 * 
 * The names of GZPSs & XTOL, TXMTs, contents of STR should match.
 * 
 * COLL : should be one, group = 0x4F184AA9, instance set to the new general groupID; referred to by some 3IDRs.

// How to extract the similarities between the named stuff?
// We assume
//##[group id]![specific name, potentially multiple split with _][potentially _ and type extension]
/*
 * txtrs may not have the group id thing if they are a default replacement.
 * txtr, txmt have the extention on their names.
 * however, the references/internal stuff in txmts shouldn't use them.
 * cpfs and the stuff from str do not.
 * 
 * So:
 * regex to match/break away the group id section
 * split the rest based on _, look at the last thingie in case of the txtr and txmt
 * or only split the last _ based on regex?
 * option to add or replace smt in the names themselves?
